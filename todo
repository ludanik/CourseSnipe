To do:

CLI interface (add GUI later, probably not necessary)
	-headless option, enabled by default ✓
	-option to list courses ✓
	
	-option to add course ✓
	-option to transfer course section ✓
	-option to remove course ✓
	
	-option to set email ✓
	-option to set time interval (by default: 120 seconds) ✓
	-option to set user ✓

Integrate CLI with existing script

Integrate transfer functionality

Email/SMS upon course enrollment (probably just email)

Add support for Fedora, Windows, Mac? 
	- just need to find path of geckodriver automatically

Integrate exchange functionality (might be unwise but worth a try)

Add hints to CLI commands for ease of use
