To do:

Add support for Fedora, Windows, Mac? 
        - just need to find path of geckodriver automatically
	- seems to work but i should test on Windows as well

Add session persistence, so user doesn't have to authenticate with Duo every time
	-tried with firefox profiles, no documentation so unclear what to 
	actually do
	-tried with cookies, but the right data isn't captured so session	
	isn't saved
	-tried with chrome profiles, but chrome doesn't want to save session 
	data when opened by selenium for some reason. documentation is unclear
	and often contradictory
	-need to test on other machines and os

Email/SMS upon course enrollment (probably just email)

Integrate exchange functionality (might be unwise but worth a try)

Course priority function
	-because interval is so long, it will be nice to prioritize certain cour	ses over others
	-ex. course 1 is checked 70% of the time, course 2 is checked 30% of the 	time
