To do:

Add support for Fedora, Windows, Mac? 
        - just need to find path of geckodriver automatically

Add cookies, so user doesn't have to authenticate with Duo every time

CLI interface (add GUI later, probably not necessary)
	-headless option, enabled by default ✓
	-option to list courses ✓
	
	-option to add course ✓
	-option to transfer course section ✓
	-option to remove course ✓
	
	-option to set email ✓
	-option to set time interval (by default: 120 seconds) ✓
	-option to set user ✓
	-option to set password ✓
	-option to input path (so no need to guess)

	-add hints to cli commands for ease of use ✓
	-integrate cli with existing script ✓

Integrate transfer functionality

Email/SMS upon course enrollment (probably just email)

Integrate exchange functionality (might be unwise but worth a try)

Course priority function
	-because interval is so long, it will be nice to prioritize certain cour	ses over others
	-ex. course 1 is checked 70% of the time, course 2 is checked 30% of the 	time
