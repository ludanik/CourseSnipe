To do:
CLI interface (add GUI later, probably not necessary)
	-headless option, enabled by default
	-option to list courses
	
	-option to add course
	-option to transfer course
	-option to remove course
	
	-option to add email
	-option to set user
	-option to set password
	-option to input path (so no need to guess)

Integrate transfer functionality
Email/SMS upon course enrollment (probably just email)
Add support for Fedora, Windows, Mac? 
	- just need to find path of geckodriver automatically
