To do:

Add support for MacOS
	-need someone with a mac to test

Email/SMS upon course enrollment (probably just email)

Improvements to CLI
	-support for multiple args in add and remove functions (to enroll full s	chedule at once, for example)

Integrate exchange functionality
	-just need to add a corresponding selenium function, cli function alread	y exists

Course priority function
	-because interval is so long, it will be nice to prioritize certain cour	ses over others
	-ex. course 1 is checked 70% of the time, course 2 is checked 30% of the 	time
